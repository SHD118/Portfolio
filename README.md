## About Me
I am in the field of information technology and seeking to become a full-stack developer. Born and raised in NJ and recently moved to Colorado and currently working fully remote. Living with my lovely wife and a puppy named Hiro in Broomfield Colorado. I graduated from NJIT with a degree in Computer science. I spent most of my career at Lockeed Martin as an engineer and now coming close to my 2 year mark at PSEG. I am always a team player and often go out of my way to help others whenever I can. I love learning and can spend hours reading about topics that interest me such as hydroponics, philosophy, physics, technology and much more. One of my goals is to create a nonprofit to help promote hydroponics to areas around the world where soil isnâ€™t rich and water is sparse. If my profile sparks interest and if I can contribute to your team feel free to reach out.

### Code Breakdown

HTML/CSS Breakdown

- Created a skeleton keeping in mind semantics
  - Created a header and put all the navigation code in it
    - Create a navbar
      - Created a title set to my name in the navbar
        - Float: left
        - Used margin/padding for further position

      - Nav\_items
        - Unordered list
        - Display: flex
        - Float: right
        - Using margin and padding I was able to position the items precisely as I wanted them to display
        - Used pseudo class hover to change font color to aqua upon hovering over it
        - Linked all nav item to the corresponding section on the webpage
  - Created a section called banner to fit an image (background), text and a profile picture of myself in it
    - First I set a height of 400px and width to 100%
    - Set a background to fill the space in
    - I used divs to set the profile pic, banner-text and quote\_name within the section
    - Than within the styling used display inline
    - Used a google font {font-family: &#39;Spirax&#39;, cursive;} for the banner text
    - Leverage float:right for the text and float left for the profile picture
    - Lastly used margins and padding for exact positioning
  - Created a About me section

    - Created an aside tag and set the class to a border styling class
      - Border styling: margin:left, border: right and height set to 200px
    - Styled the about\_me p tags to have margin positioning
  - Created a work section
    - The work section is set to display flex and flex-wrap to contain all the content evenly in the rows
    - Within the work section I created div set to 5 work\_div
      - Displayed set to relative
      - I set the height and width as well as set some margins for position
      - The work div will contain an image of a project but for now I just set a linear-gradient color scheme as a placeholder
      - The first work\_div doe currently contain an image of the refactoring project when clicked on take you to the github project
      - I realized you can&#39;t link to another page in css since I set the background image in the css. I realize I encountered a problem. The way I resolved it was by onclick=&quot;window.location=&quot;url&quot; function in the html.
      - The size of work\_div:first child width and height set to be bigger than the rest of the work\_div to showcase my main project
      - Within each work\_div i added another div with a class called &quot;caption&quot; and a h3 tag
      - The caption overlays the name of the project with the text in the p tag
      - I added a pseudo class so when you hover the opacity changes to 1 and the image rotate slight with a box shadow
  - Created a section for resume
    - Within the section I add an aside and set it to a border class to float left
    - Then created another div set to the resumer\_container class which:
      - Has a width 60% and height to 200px
      - I also added a border and gave it some padding and margin for positioning
      - Finally used a linear-gradient for the background
      - Aligned the .resume\_contain p tags to be text-aligned centered
      - Finally created a button that sent user to a print/download page for my resume by placing my resume in my image directly and using the following
      - The button is set to display and center aligned
      - The button has styling set to it for color, padding, margin, border radius., boxing shadowing.
  - Finally I ended my main content tag
  - Create a footer for all the contact information
  - I first created a class called contact
    - I set the width to 100&amp; and display to flex
    - Than created ul/li tags to list everything and since I used flex they will be displayed in rows
    - I set the text-alignment to center and did some styling for margin, padding and font
  - Lastly created media queries so when the max width is set to 770px the webpage will do the following:
    - The page will change to columns to be more user friendly
    - Change fonts to display more clear as the screen sizes reduce
    - Made all the borders to display below the columns
